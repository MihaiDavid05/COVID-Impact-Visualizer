## Milestone 1 (7th April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

We have selected three high-quality datasets for our project, which will serve as the foundation for our analysis.
- [Data on COVID-19 (coronavirus) by Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)
- [European Flights by Eurocontrol](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-07-12)
- [Impact of Covid-19 on Employment by ILOSTAT](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vineethakkinapalli/impact-of-covid19-on-employment-ilostat)

To further enhance our analysis, we will utilize two additional datasets for the enrichment (e.g., calculating the number of cases per 1000 people and getting airport latitude and longitude).
- [Population estimated and projections by The World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/population-estimates-and-projections/preview/on)
- [IATA/ICAO List by IP2Location](https://github.com/ip2location/ip2location-iata-icao)

We have conducted an initial analysis of the datasets and have found them to be of high quality, with minimal missing values and outliers.

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
